# Homework-02

## What I did and how I did it

For this project, I was suppose to create a portfolio website to display my previous work that could be used in the future. This portfolio I have created is quite close to the mock-up example provided in the description for the homework. I have taken a few liberties in the portfolio and will most likely change aspects of the portfolio as my skill grows and my techniques become more unique and well-defined. I, at the current moment, do not have alot of examples of previous work to display, so I am currently using a placeholder until I have more accomplishments under my belt to display. I used hyperlinks to jump to new sections of the page by using id attribute for certain sections of the page. I desired to use the class attribute to make the CSS code more clean and organized, but when testing different methods to activate the page jumping, none but the id attribute appeared to work, so I was forced to use those instead. Due to the animation of the mock-up being very quick and difficult to see, I used the Horreseon homework from week 1 as a visual inspiration to do the header of the page and the links to jump to different sections of the page. I wanted to add a fun fact aside element to the page to help fill it out and not leave empty space, but due to flex and the shifting of the page, I was unable and will be forced to add that aside element later in the course when I have more skill.
